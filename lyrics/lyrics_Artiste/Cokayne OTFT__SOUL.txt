Verse 1 : Cokayne OTFT

Couple Millions, Leave in Texas

Man we pray for it all

365, We grinding hard

We ain't playing at all

F**k it

To all 'em haters  F**k  you

On the gold rush

Rap game's faded

They be facking, Trust me

Coming from the city where no n**gaz was a dreamer

Poured my heart in this b*tch, Placed My Soul for this Sh*t

F**cken Track Boy that's what they call me

Cuz I F**k everything

Riding through the city, B*tches call me COCO

They be mad at a young n**gaz

Cuz I grind erryday

The Music the music

Man got no other option

If it's for money I got racks

Working so hard that I got packs

N**gaz so jealous

I made it I'm winning

You reep what you sow

It's like Hallelujah


Pre-Chorus :


Its something from GOD

Ill leave it for nothing

This feeling i got

Its my heart speaking

We are in this bitch

Jmj in this bitch

Not a night for life just like

I did give it my

 


CHORUS

SOULLLLL…SOULLLL….SOULLL

Verse 2 : Van Blaze


 VOILENCE  grab the pines to kiss the petals

This success of a cycle am pushing onto its pedal.

SILENCE cut my tongue before the sentence,shot reasons for resentment

That forked tongues could judge my difference

You gave me pain took my pride hope inside full of lies

Uncoded my feelings room to grant you access forever  better

Love i lost freinds inside foryour trust gaveup all

How much deep that it hurts but nothing better and

I hate that i love you

I wish i could kill you

YOU did nothing to deserve it

Possesion my holliness could not stand

You thought me how to love

Thought me how to be me

With you its raining hearts my umbrella in my pocket and gone

 


Pre-Chorus

Its something from GOD

Ill leave it for nothing

This feeling i got

Its my heart speaking

We are in this bitch

Jmj in this bitch

 

Not a night for life just like

I did give it my

 


CHORUS

SOULLLLL…SOULLLL….SOULLL

SOULLL…SOULLLLL….SOULLLL
