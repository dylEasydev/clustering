 Fire 




Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Situation don change
What are we going to do
There's no longer a safe place
This system is so fake
When it's black they say that it's white
And when you're doing the good
You be the bad man
Fire fire fire (fire burn them)
Fire fire fire
Say fire fire fire fire
Father send your fire
Of purification out of heaven
Father send your fire over us
Send your commando
With your charriot
Fire ah ah ah
(Fire Fire Fire)
What we gonna do do do
The way the world's going and nobody cares
Do do do
What we gonna do do do
The way things are going and nobody cares
Do do do
Fire fire fire (fire burn them)
Fire fire fire
Say fire fire fire fire
Father send your fire
Of purification out of heaven
Father send your fire over us
Send your commando
With your charriot
Fire ah ah ah
Fire fire fire
Fire fire fire
