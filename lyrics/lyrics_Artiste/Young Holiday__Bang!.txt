 Bang!




I flow powerful like God used a pen to stap me

And now that heavenly ink is running thru ma atteries

I don’t aim at you; I aim for awards and Grammies

I have concern for the kids and that’s why I be rapping

Am literally giving them instructions

The pictures that I paint are maps leading us to treasures

And every rhyme like a contour ever wondered why am giving space

So you can know the best of things are actually plain

I used to feed on my fears but lately I’ve been starving

Anything that brings the truth ends up like Gaddafi

So when they try to kill my vibe I understand the tactics

But giving up is not the price please do not distract me

With flows harder than the hearts of Kamer leaders

Afraid to open up like my life is a French reader

But when I do am too deadly am a fire breeder

Let’s be real for once, don’t step in my arena

It’s not a fight for recognition when you’re real it’s reciprocal

Here we gat kings and queens like we playing poker

That’s the thing with those who hate, they miss the point

Life is a bitch giving heads; I don’t need to toss a coin

There were trying to fit the right pecks in the right holes


I took the respect and I hid them in ma flows

Then gave the rest pects and kept the kiss of dead for bones

I will never disrespect an elder talkless of a God you know

But am not one of those toilet roll rappers

Who need to kiss to stay relevant yeah am elegant

Judging by the punches that I spit am a veteran

I am no grass; I am one of the elephants

Living legend, lyrically lieutenant, leading like limunba

When I spit I keep it hot, lucifer’s lubricant

Leaving looser looking like they lavish left overs

Who goes to war and don’t expect to see dead soldiers

I come prepared with an invincible legion

Your whole crew against the wolves and he be giving you seizures

That abino guy is dope, isn’t he? That’s the tag question

If your responds negative please do not mention

If I ever rap for cloud you will see the silver linning

Am out here bodying these clowns who the hell untied me

While they work 6 to 6 I triple the 6

So when I tell you am the beast I cannot be lying

I only see you cause am looking at the bigger picture

When the servants are allowed to pose with the king

You dressed as royalty but then recognize the posture

It’s hard to stand up right when you the lamest in the pic

My next big shot is to take lot of small shots

Aiming at those rappers who cannot survive the big gunz

The vultures, the krotals, emblems of our culture

When is hip-hop talking dude, I suggest you go dumb
