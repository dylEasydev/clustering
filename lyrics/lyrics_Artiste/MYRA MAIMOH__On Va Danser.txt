 Verse 1

Oh My Oh My!

I can't believe we're home

I can smell the ocean breeze though my windowpanes

Green red yellow flag, floating in the wind

Delighted by the flavours in the air

Tonight is the night, we gon' paint the city red

Calling all my boys and girls

Its the party of the year, we'll let trouble go

Celebrate with everyone

Put your hands up in the air with me

and shake it till you drop




CHORUS

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh On Va danser

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh On Va Swinger

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh Toujours dans l'ambiance

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh On Va bouger

A Gauche a droite, put your hands up in the air

A Guache A Droite, put your hands up in the air




Verse 2

Oh My God!

So much love to share

Surrounded by my friends and all my family

Laughter in the air, Kids playing games

People lining up to hit the stage again

Tonight is the night, we gon' paint the city red

All the neighbours joining in

It’s the time of the year

To let worries go

Celebrate with everyone

Put your hands up in the air with me and shake it till you drop

 


CHORUS

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh On Va danser

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh On Va Swinger

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh Toujours dans l'ambiance

Oh wei oh  oh wei oh On Va bouger

A Gauche à droite, put your hands up in the air

A Guache, à Droite, put your hands up in the air
