VERSE 2
 (Dex Willy)

Brown face, pretty girl

The type of girl that you see and you can't live.

I told that my name was Dex and she said she aint fucking

But she aint gettin words i tell her i'll fuck her

And i'm a thug baby we'll be thug lovers.

Don't think in your mind that imma give flowers.

A big gun, and a big bunch of money

We are friends for sure baby we can be more that it.

We started when w'were young, now we growing older.

And baby imma show you that my love goes higher

I'never stop today , imma go for ever

We are two friends today but we can be lovers




CHORUS

It seems love you

You can be more than friend

Everything you like

I will give you

Let's me know girl if you like

It seems love you

You can be more than friend

Everything you like

I will give you

Let's me know girl if you like
