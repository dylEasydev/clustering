Sometimes this world is full of persecutions

And alone I feel so weak

I won’t hesitate to keep you in my heart

Cause your strength is all I need

Sometimes the world is full for persecutions

And alone I feel so weak

I won’t hesitate to take my holy chain

‘Cause your love is all I need



That’s the way you change my life (x 8)

Like You deny for gree na Jehovah protects you

Ask yourself the question for me

Who gave you the life you cherish (Can’t you see)

When the lord returns he will put me by his side

He loves me every day Monday to Sunday (always)

He loves me every day Monday to Sunday
