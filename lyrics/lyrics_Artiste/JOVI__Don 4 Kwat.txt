 Don 4 Kwat




Ask Petit them for Kwat I dey for here for helep

Early morning Time I dey veranda with e Cheleps

Bring me cold shack open’am with teeth

When I drink drunk show me any wall for Piss

When I finish Shack I di turn chat chap

Take yi go ma house blow’am then I turn start tchack

You di talk for Kwat sey I Be mbanga Boy

You di beg Mimbo You Be Na Langa Boy

Enough said na enemies are not Death

By the time I’m done with them the boy dem go cough red

You go see blood because you di run mop

You di bark you no di bite oh boy you be na ngong dog

No di high like Garri Mop di smell like Voirie

I fresh like fish ask ma Kojo Man Harry

Ma Tory short yi no get part two

Don Kwata Style mon gars je suis partout


[CHORUS]

Me I Be Na Don 4 Kwat

Oh Boy I Be Na Don 4 Kwat

I di Lob, I do ma thing Kwata Style

 Me I Be Na Don 4 Kwat

Oh Boy I Be Na Don 4 Kwat

I di Lob, I do ma thing Kwata Style




Pity yourself I beg no pity me

The whole club Sick I di Cause epidemic

Deadly with delivery I bring much pain

I drown your whole mind to Misery

Haters e killing me Oh Silly Me

Who would have know even park boys will be feeling me

It’s strange things change

When money comes things will never be the same

I rather kick the bucket than have an empty pocket

Fast ways fast money shoot like a rocket

Ahead Ahead I go finish Ma Fufu

When the money come you go gimme the Tutu

And When I Nackam, the Koum Koum go tight

We go poundam turn am till the Koum Koum is Right.

Massa No bi Lie Me I be na don

I dong Don So tey Trong what have I never done


CHORUS
