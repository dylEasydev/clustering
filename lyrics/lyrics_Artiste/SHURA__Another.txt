 Another




Have you ever been in love with someone you get hard

It hurt, oh it hurt

You see them passing by

And you can’t even dare to say

Hello! Hello!

It hurts to see your heart with another

It hurts to see your love with another

The way he cherishes and loves another

To see him holding hands with another


Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another

Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another

Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another

Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another


I tried to love him but it’s hard

I tried to leave him but it’s hard

I don’t wanna hurt him anymore

But I don’t love him anymore

C’est pas facile de tout laisser

Car je ne sais pas ce qui m’attend

Je ne sais pas ce qui m’attend

E di hurt me how i dey hurt the man

Whey e love me very much

But I don’t love him anymore

E di hurt me how i dey hurt the man

Whey e love me very much

But I don’t love him anymore


Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another

Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another

Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another

Am in love with another

He loves another

I have another
