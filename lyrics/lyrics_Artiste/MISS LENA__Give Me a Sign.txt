 Give Me a Sign




Don't you find it silly baby

You're there and I am here but I feel like

We're kinda connected baby

We never really talked but when we talk I can complete ya



“B****ch you're crazy ,stop tripping “

That's what my girls say but I can not help it

I just need you so won't you




[CHORUS]:

Give me a sign

And I’ll come to you ....( i'll come to you baby )

Give me a sign

And I’ll come to you ....( i'll come to you baby )





I usually never say

Such silly things but the chemistry is undeniable

I don't mean to scare you off , I know it's unusual but..

I just thought that we could go somewhere to

Talk about those common things we share

I d love to know you better

what s your favorite flavour ?

Chocolate or vanilla ?



“B****ch you're crazy ,stop tripping “

That's what my girls say but I can not help it

I just need you so won't you




CHORUS



Yeah ,you already know you can...

Hit me up on Facebook , call me on Skype

Whatever you like , Whatsapp or Twitter

I mean ...I am on board

You just need to give me that sign




CHORUS



(give me give me a sign… give me give me a sign…..)
