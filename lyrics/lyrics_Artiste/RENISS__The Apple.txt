 The Apple




 O ntong gha

ghre ma yea nzouboo koum

O negg gha , Baba mou ntem gho

Na me this I di nzouboo koum

O ghei ma nkong gho

Be ma nghouk,ma shik,ma ntem

O ghei ma nkong gho

Once you know me, You know that I’m the one

Once you know that, You will know what to do

Be Baba songeh m’a nghouk,Ma nghouk,nghouk

Be Baba songeh m’a shik

 


[CHORUS]
 :

Once you bite that apple (apple, apple)

Na so ya eye di shine, You di see good and bad

Once you bite that apple (apple, apple)

You go know say, black no bi white

Na so that thing di sweet for mop

And when you try you no go stop

Why you di tell me say you love me

You have no right to tell that, You and I know that

Say you get your woman

Cuz I know say wrong no bi right



Once you bite that apple...

 


[JOVI]

I’m so blessed, na why you di vex,

I don’t give a f., ma life no be na test

I know that the rest won’t see all the stress

I go through, okay I don’t need to impress

She hate rape but she love rough sex

Okay what I’m saying, is simply complex

Make sure all ma enemies never offended me

I no di fear da one na fake threats

Die no free you get for buy coffin

I di pump njap massa i’m always coughing

I no want die oh boy like life

But when u tchop life, life too go tchop you

I see many, I trust few

I’m not perfect, I sin too

No blame Adam if Eve was naked

Seriously...

 

M’a mbouboo Papa yea nkwatte ghe

O chei nghe-ka-m’a ghe ntou gho

Ngkwarre ntem gha, nkette ntem gha

M’a nghouk,m’a shik ,M’a lein-gne, m’a teme

M’a nghouk,m’a shik ,M’a lein-gne, m’a teme

Ngkwarre ntem gha, nkette ntem gha
