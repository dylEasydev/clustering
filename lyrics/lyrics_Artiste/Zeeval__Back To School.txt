My papa be de tell me

Na only time go reveal us the truth

Yi papa be de tell yi

Na only time go reveal them the truth

Lately, we've come to realize

Alot of things we don't even know

Truly, we've been kept in the dark for far too long

Make wuna hear me

Time don reach you to rise again

Time don reach for we to rise again

Black Melanin is for you queen

I no see why you go de bleach your skin

Make no man no tell you say you be inferior

But for their mind you be na superior


Anytime we unite, na them di break us

Anytime we fight, them wan divide us

Can't you see we get for go back to school

Anytime we unite, na them di break us

Anytime we fight, them wan divide us

Can't you see we get for go back to school

We need some education

We need some education

Them di taking all our gold and our diamonds down

Popopo-oh! Bullets flying we no understand oh oh

Them di taking everything back to the white man's land

Them di taking all our gold and our diamonds down

Popopo-oh! YeeeeÂ  oh oh


My papa be de tell me

Black Melanin is for you queen

I no see why you go de bleach your skin

Make no man no tell you say you be inferior

But for their mind you be na superior
