 That Nana




[Pre chorus]

I know we're meeting for the first time

But I swear I never ever felt like this before

Wanna make u my screensaver

She says she'll love it thanks but she's going

Oh no no no no


[Chorus]

That Nana hmm

She wanna make me run after her like we acting drama hmm ayayaya

Oh that nana hmmm

She wanna make me after her like we're cartoons tom and Jerry hmm ayayaya


 [verse1]

Wi you take some ice or a lil drink uhuh nah

Coffee or pudding uhuh nah

Your number for a rendez vous

whatever that nana's not interested

I looked at you and had a dream uhuh nah

No Luther King uhuh

I was talking bout'a you and me

Whatever that nana's not interested

Ok I'm gonna go my way

Go on a hot ride and leave single here

I promise with me it'll never be boring

But she says non deja vue

I see you waiting I'll never do it to you

You're single her I'll always be with you

Whatever you want I'm gonna buy it to you

But she says non deja vue


[Chorus]


[Verse 2]

Yeah If you tell me walk like this then I will walk like this

I swear this is the first time that I ever talk like this owééi

I'll do everything it takes girl to have a kiss

And it will be better if it is on your lips

I wanna make you my lover

Cuz you're the perfect lady for me

The way you're making your nyanga

Dictates the pulses of my heart beat

Now I'm going gaga

No freaks that's not my still naah

I swear on my papa

Je te yamo ooh


[Chorus]
