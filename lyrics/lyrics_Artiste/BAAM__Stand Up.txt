 Stand Up




Hahahaha…. Hahahaha

Hahahaha …Hahahaha


Everything’s messed up that’s for sure

People suffering and dying I don’t know

I look around everything seems so slow (oh oh oh oh)

They push, we struggle no result

The same problems never resolved

This hustling is for nothing and nothing (nothing)


Take it slow, we will find

A way to get out of this

All we should do is believe

Let go

Don’t be afraid, it will be alright

Don’t give up,

Everything everything’s gonna be just fine


[CHORUS] :

This life, has got so many complications (If we)

Can face the situation (Then we)

Are gonna walk to the platform of victory

It’s a true story


Stand up!

Hahahahahaha aaa ehhh


This is Baam

What we’re bringing to you will make you bounce

But don’t bounce and get bad

Where to start is right up in your mind

Then you will find it All will come in time

Don’t let frustration lead you into crime

The definition of life will be fine

As is the junction in the middle of the cross

Is the function of your brain in a choice

If you let the rage take over the brain

There is nothing that you‘ll gain

The hatred and pain we’ve got to keep it sane

So let’s start all over again


CHORUS


Hah ahahah ahaha aaa eh Stand up

Hahhahahahahaha eeh stand up


This is my cry

I look from left to right

But nothing seems right

The rich are getting richer

And the poor are getting poorer

Yet I know there’s coming a time

When everything’s gonna be fine


Hahahahah haha a ha aha eeeeh

Stand up


CHORUS
