 Brokenhearted




[Verse 1]

Questions pouring to my head

What have you been doing lately

Where ?when? With who ?

Flashes of you and me side by side

Our moments of intimacy

ThenÂ  am struck down a bullet to my heart

Reminds me that you are long gone

My friend is gone -my lover's gone

I am so sad - you left me so




[CHORUS] :

Brokenhearted

I can breathe, my heart is falling down

Brokenhearted (hey )

Brokenhearted

You left me so ...




[Verse2]

I can't heal ,the cut is deep

I still feel it like it was yesterday

Sleepless nights ,talking on the phone

It did not matter who was right or wrong

I was knocked down

Knees on the floor

Cause you could'nt find a reason to fight for us

Believee in us, believe in us

I am so sad- you left me so




CHORUS



[Bridge ]

Look what you did

Look what you did to me (x4 )




CHORUS
