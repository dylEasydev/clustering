A mvoé dzam oo(mvoé dzam ohé)

mayem akia wò yõn mayem enying  isiki zeze dzom  anë bake bakilen dana

A mvoé enying dzoé, enying dzoé oo

A mvoé tòbege mvoè te wò yöne oo kanga ngùl oo



What ever comes and what ever goes

You'll be fine I wanna let you know

Hit the way you'll be okay

What ever comes and what ever goes (enying dzoé enë indzam a manyang, tòbege ivol oo)

You'll be fine I wanna let you know

Sing with me cause you'll be okay

Tsaratsaa...
