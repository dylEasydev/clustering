Hair is tough

Ouuh ouuh oouh her hips

They want to know

Na who born this kind pikin eh


Nothing is the same

When we walk by

When we infiltrate, we go the mile

We take the world by storm

Lupita to Lola

Leave the boys in awe they misbehave

Boy you know you’re wrong

I’m not that easy, take over the world

In a minute of my day

Boy hold on, hold on

Hold on baby


Hair is tough

Ouuh ouuh oouh her hips

They want to know

Na who born this kind pikin eh

Hair is tough

Ouuh ouuh oouh her hips

He wants to know

Na who born this afro beauty


The afro woman comes in many shades

With luscious lips of life

Hips of a goddess

Bronze, brass, gold

Glory of God

Ulanda to helen

Leave the world in awe they recognize

Every time I see I look too

Mama you are, you are made in glory

Boy you know you’re wrong

I’m not that easy

Boy hold on, hold on

Hold on baby


Hair is tough

Ouuh ouuh oouh her hips

They want to know

Na who born this kind pikin eh

Hair is tough

Ouuh ouuh oouh her hips

He wants to know
