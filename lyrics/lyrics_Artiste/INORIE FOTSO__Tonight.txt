 Tonight




Tonight is gonna be the night

Turn off the lights, You ‘ll be my ride

Together for life

Making love all night

Before we go through the night

Before I kiss you good night

Baby want you be mine

Now till the end of time




[CHORUS]
:

Hey, hey hey hey hey hey

Tonight oh oh oh oho oh

Be mine Hey, hey hey hey hey hey

Tonight oh oh oh oh oho oh

hey hey hey hey hey all night



Tonight is gonna be the night

 you and I, will stay high

Keep it fly, Hold me tight, all night

Be my ride, Do me hot, Make me high

 All night




CHORUS



 I am gonna be yours oooh

 If you treat me right (baby hold on)

There is no going back

So make up your mind

Tonight is for life

Tonight annhhhaaa ....
