 African Hope




[VERSE 1]

The truth about Africa you know mennn

Africans gat to be educated

Cause these are the signs of good leadership

Let’s be wise enough you know;

To invest in our  continent

And stop shipping all our resources

Out to other continents over there mennn

Africa is a land of great technology

Great fortunes and great people living on

We had all we needed you know

But they took it all away from us

By slavery and slave trade which took away our four father’s off

Who made them great with our own talents

But now no access to them

Like Spain hooking up on us

No way into their country…

Bitter truth

Better said , Let’s say it


[CHORUS]

This is Africa

African Hope...

Grown in Africa with African Dreams

This is Africa

African Home

Born in Africa

With African talent and skills


[VERSE 2]

When ar said to be educated

I meant wise up enough you know Yeahhh

We’ve gat everything you know yeahhh

We gat resources, technologies

Fortunes, raw materials all you know Them.

Example on: like   ar diamond and  gold taken up to Europe

Making them higher We tired

So African business climate should put an End to

economic and social refugeism

Cause through refugeism

Africa has lost great talents to America et  European nation’s

Such talents they’ve detected and developed

For them pride prestige to develop their host countries with

While Africa goes down low

Low low…

[CHORUS]

This is Africa

African Hope...

Grown in Africa with African Dreams

This is Africa

African Home

Born in Africa

With African talent and skills


[BRIDGE]

Awards should have been given to great leaders like

Helen Johnson, Alphar Omar Konar

J.J Rawling, Thomas Sankara

Not forgetting Barrack Obama

Kings are born in Africa you know

Legends born in Africa you know

I think this generation gonna keep the wiseness

To invest in our continent

Keep our  resources Build our nation’s

Limiting the importaion of products

That can compete and kill home industries

And let jobs be created for the promotion of home industries.

Legends that “made it” here in Africa

Samuel Etoo, Lokua kanza

MYriam makiba

So you could too


[CHORUS]

This is Africa

African Hope...

Grown in Africa with African Dreams

This is Africa,

African Home

Born in Africa

With African talent and skills
