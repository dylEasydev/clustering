Ahh ! Yeaah

See, I've been around the world and seen a lotta jets

And I know that one should be Yours

You aint even gotta worry, you aint even gotta sweat

Cos you know the boy ready to be Yours

And when I step inside Louis and I am picking out tees

Girl I know at least one should be Yours

When I'm popping Rosé with the girls out here

When the Champagne really should be Yours

And I'm feeling like a boss



Can't nobody tell me nothing, I'm higher than gods

But I'm ready to be right next to you when the night sets

Mama no keys up the door

Na who be di thief, na who be de liar, na who be di baga (baga),

Na who bi di sexy, na who be di best
