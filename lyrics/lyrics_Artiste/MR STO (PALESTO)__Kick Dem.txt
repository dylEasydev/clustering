 Kick Dem




Man I dey there , Man I dey there

Yes me kick them, (Kick them),  Mr. Sto I fi kick them (Kick them)



Yo Nigger Shy, lourd

Upon this rhythm mi should

Breaking all di nose and di tooth

Boom! while good vibe is ina mi root

Good dance surround mi boot

Here is the real bully foot

Stepping up in the night to kick kick

Yo yo yo! Boy better know!

Palesto di blow! Palesto di rule

Kick them well, get couzy at the room

Mister Murder rhythm fi make boom

Switch on the camera push upon the zoom

Me turn in a wolf cause it’s the full moon

Murder, coming real soon, Man I dey there

You confuse by the tune, The Thing come true

The King come through

Make the sun boy turn in a fool




[CHORUS ] :

Kick them, kick them, Kick them, kick them

Party man ina di rhythm I fi hit them

Kick them, kick them, Kick them, kick them

Give the mic, this beat I go beat them

Kick them, kick them, Kick them, kick them

Oh, no! yes I di hit them

Kick them all kick them all

Make them silly with some real dancehall



Flying like a butterfly, hit like a bee

Something everybody can see

Lyrics make you feel high like sensee

Nobody better than me

Kick them well till they can no more breathe

Boom bye bye, in yur head, Yo man I dey there

I fi kick them with no pity

Filling the high ration

Come upon the radio station

Me hot your feet like it’s an aggression

The lyrical operates a verbal oppression

It’s like they done gun legalisation

What! Feel the hot vibration

What! Bossy na the dobe! Bossy na the dobe

I ma beat on them spit on them, step on them. Yom n me ..




CHORUS
