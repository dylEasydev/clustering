Over me, over me

Over me, over me


I be di fear woman like wintch o (fear woman like wintch o)

But suddenly you teach o (suddenly you teach o)

Say true love do exist (true love exist)

And I guess that what it is (guess that what it is)

Cuz when you tickle me e sweet o (tickle me e sweet o)

When you shot me for I wish you (shot for me I wish you o)

And if this isn't true love (isn't true love)

Then tell me what it is


Anywhere you go, girl I will follow you

There's no reason to leave

Baby I'll come with you no

And if you stay, then I'll stay with you

Loving you all the way

I swear I love this feeling


Is my house really a home when you're not here?

Teach me this your love

Do that thing way sweet me for body o

Is my life really alive when you're not here?

Teach me this your love

Run to me, run to me

I go hold you down like a G

We'll be banging till we're 80

We'll be wasted, we'll be lazy

Like meat inside achu

Baby you di sweetie me


Anywhere you go, girl I will follow you

There's no reason to leave

Baby I'll come with you no

And if you stay, then I'll stay with you

Loving you all the way

I swear I love this feeling


Is my house really a home when you're not here?

Teach me this your love

Do that thing way sweet me for body o

Is my life really alive when you're not here?

Teach me this your love

Do that thing way, sweet me for body o


Over, over me

Over me, over me

It's all over
