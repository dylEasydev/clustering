But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh


Oh! Them talking, we hustling

Them loosers, we winners

We think hard, we got dreams

To make it big, them bizzare

Risktakers we don't sleep.

We take risks no matter what it takes

Ready for the race, always in a haste

Got no time to waste, hardwork never fails

Ambition is priceless

Never give up we heading for the best

Challenges just a test

Styleen Sesseko yeah blessed

Always cool no complex

Working hard while praying for the best

People never know what you going through

Just to make it big, all they want is eat

God is good, always good

What you reap is what you sowed.

White or black our dress code

Ever young like we not getting old

Hiphop pays I suppose

Never knew the success was so close

Wearing better clothes, shooting good videos

If you nobi know is obvious now you know


[REFRAIN]:

I no bi know, I no bi know

I no bi know, I no bi know

But now I know, But now I know

But now I know, But now I know

I no bi know eeeeh, I nobi know eeeeh

But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh

(ONE MORE TIME!!!!!)

I no bi know, I no bi know

I no bi know, I no bi know

But now I know, But now I know

But now I know, But now I know

I no bi know eeeeh, I nobi know eeeeh

But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh


Yeah! I've been there, now am here

Waiting for my turn to make them hear

You can't stop me is my year

Giving all the best to make them fear

Hard knock life am prepared

If you wanna fight me am right here

Make sure you beat me coz if you don't

I will make you regret why you were born

Why shoot a stone when u live in a glass house?

Am not a boss but I live in my own house.


People will hate you when they know you broke

You make it they love you so get up and work

Life is a hustle for hustlers we look for customers

No time to hang with the idlers

Show me your friends and I tell who you are

Birds of the same feathers flock together

Fame is a drug so I smoke it with care bro

I've been a star before made it in rap bro

People will tell you what you wanna hear

When they gain from you and which is unfair

Been out of the game still am back as the best

Yeah am back as the best double SS on my chest

If you owe me you pay me no pity in buisness

And if you nobi know is obvious now you know


[REFRAIN]:

I no bi know, I no bi know

I no bi know, I no bi know

But now I know, But now I know

But now I know, But now I know

I no bi know eeeeh, I nobi know eeeeh

But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh


I no bi know, I no bi know

I no bi know, I no bi know

But now I know, But now I know

But now I know, But now I know

I no bi know eeeeh, I nobi know eeeeh

But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh


Mummy always told me my son you the best

My son you the best

My Dad always told me make sure you the first

Make sure you the first

You work hard and pray hard and so get blessed

And so you get blessed

We only can be what we destined to be

What we destined to be.

Am living my life while they gossip my name

They dirty my name while am heading to fame

So much in my head and I still be the same

Thought I was gone but am still in the game

Feeling my pain some rappers do claim

God is the one who's protecting my name

Reason why no one can wipe out my name

And if you nobi know is obvious that you know.


[REFRAIN]:

I no bi know, I no bi know

I no bi know, I no bi know

But now I know, But now I know

But now I know, But now I know

I no bi know eeeeh, I nobi know eeeeh

But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh


I no bi know, I no bi know

I no bi know, I no bi know

But now I know, But now I know

But now I know, But now I know

I no bi know eeeeh, I nobi know eeeeh

But now I know eeeeeh, But now I know eeeeeh




IF YOU NOBI KNOW NOW YOU KNOW!!!!
