 Faya Di Burn




[CHORUS]:

Fire di burn under pot

But water di freeze in the pot

Fire di burn under pot

But water di freeze in the pot

Fire di buuurrrn, Fire di buuurrrn

Fire di buuurrrn

But water di freeze in the pot

Doctor dey for wasapita

Small door dey for back chair

Wuna go wait so tey tired

(water di freeze in the pot)

If you die na you backfire

We no supposed to pay water

But when the bill come na fire

(water di freeze in the pot)

Pikin di born small pikin

E be like say na me wonder see

When I talk the people will see (water di freeze in the pot)



I no know, I wanna let it show

If somebody feel me right now

Just let it show




CHORUS



If the youth wanna work

You better give them the bolo

You better give them the bolo

Oh oh yeah

If the youth wanna work

You better give them the bolo

Give them the bolo




[MAGASCO]

Pastor pray small small

Church don turn be na power

People take God e name they play

(Water di freeze in the pot)

Take poison kill you brother

Because you man small money

And when e go weti you gain

(Water di freeze in the pot)

And I donâ€™t know, I wanna let it show

Somebody feel me



CHORUS
