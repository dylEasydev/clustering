Asiah no be help-lep

One day e go better for you

If you get nothing to say

Je suis enfant du soleil, rien ne peut …sur moi

Concentré sur mes rêves, la nuit ne m’arrêtera pas

My brother fine your wey too

See this life no be two

But things they go better for you

Me I dey fine my way

My brother fine your wey too

See this life no be two

But things they go better for you


Asiah no be help-lep

One day e go better for me

If you get nothing to say

Make you live me alone

Asiah no be help-lep

One day e go better for you

If you get nothing to say

Make you live we alone
