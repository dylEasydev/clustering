All Gold is on ma teeth

Got Gold watches on ma wrist

I know am barely bearing risk

But well if they wanna try a tease

Then imm destroy all of them hints

Prolly with the mic

yeah prolly with ma mic

I know this shit is getting sick


Brother takam easy

Make we flex on the beat

No vex if I go hard on ma text

Men c’est la vie

No be fufu I dey pop

Na garri I dey munch

So how you expect ma flow to go soft like cornflakes nigga


Pistol on their heads, finger on a trigger

Sort moi la monnaie là de la caisse

Settle it down, plan it out

Me like that porshe from behind dawg

Make we talk real men’s affaire

Cuz fortunes is what we prepare and these Gold is what we precise


See , ma wallet’s a bible

These hoes trynna counts its white pages

But just like big belle Rozayy

We count papers no more

We weigh’em so daily

Holla someone come rescue me

Ahh! Truely flow of a rapper

Welcome to the zone of a viper


Time to launch this mafia

Ma soul’s rage, Imma pour voluminous lava

I guess you feeling like a stranger right

Look, I love these niggaz hating

But fuck it so long ma flow’s drunk

I keep’em on flying colours

Yours probably on dyeing colours


Like milli’s for a battle

I got bars of horrors

No time for rumours

Am out of these humours

Trynna sketch a versus

With them psycho seniors

Men so fuck trauma, fuck drama

I mean fuck drame

I’m just truly dyeing out for ma respect nigga

Fuck drama


See me see trouble

Party full of bottle

Them bitches wanna smuggle

But opportunity like this comes once so drink until I see double

Yeah ho you can go on with the massage

While I relax off in ma jungle

Ngoma tell’em say me I be good bad boy


Am on Masonic floors

So hard to figure ma flaws

The devil trynna have full talks indoors

Telling me I had none

Truly er’words running on my lips were hell of dirty nouns

Ya think the nigga finna make it up to my soul




Naaaaaa!

I got the name Allah on ma tongue

Bible in ma head, Devil’s cure in ma lungs

Pere on call ça le “Don des Don”

Donc reste sssshht dans ton coin

Et respecte nos way a fond nos way a fond

Mon négro c’est pas le lait


Lord..

Just help me define ma life

So I could determine its span

Born to be a champion

Watch nigga!

Imam put in life in yo fans

Skatin’ on free board

Catch me rocking with them vans

This is music and not a plan

I rep FrenCHCollege Boy

Strictly restricted for the yungs

Make we toast wa cups

Ahh let’s get back to business

Cuz truly ma niggaz are destined for greatness

But truly am too blessed to the point

You could never understand it

Cuz if you wan try understand’am

You go surely loss sense

Dey waka waka like Stanley enow

Hustle for money and power

Then swagga swagga like dope boyz

Coke boyz

Back to marry the game like the choc boyz

Shout out to the G.R.Y. nation

But the truth is

Hip hop is strictly takin over

RIP to Makossa

Ah ah don’t envy me

Am just out of my senses

Ah sincerely

I was so thought how to put things into their right places

Into their right pl..
