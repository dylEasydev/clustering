 Better




The sun didn’t rise up this morning

The flowers are dry, they are crying yeah

It feels like the world is ending, is ending

Am I monster for being a lucky one

Or an angel bearing all of the hate

Am I monster for being a lucky one

The lucky one, the lucky one, the lucky one

They say better, better, better

Better days are coming ahead

Keep that smile in your face

Cuz better days are coming your way

They say better, better, better

Better days are coming ahead

Keep that smile in your face

Cuz better days are coming your way


You're shining so bright but still lonely

Your family thinks that you're crazy

You got everything still complaining, still complaining yeah

Am I monster for being a lucky one

Or an angel bearing all of the hate

Am I monster for being a lucky one

The lucky one, the lucky one the lucky one

They say better, better, better

Better days are coming ahead

Keep that smile in your face

Cuz better days are coming your way

They say better, better, better

Better days are coming ahead

Keep that smile in your face

Cuz better days are coming your way


I don’t wanna be here no more

I don’t wanna be here

I don’t wanna be here no more

I don’t wanna be here no more

No more, no more


They say better, better, better

Better days are coming ahead

Keep that smile in your face

Cuz better days are coming your way oh oh

They say better, better, better

Better days are coming ahead

Keep that smile in your face

Cuz better days are coming your way
