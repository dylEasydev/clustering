VERSE 1
 (STANLEY ENOW)

All eyes on me

This Bakala people dem di check with me

Cameroon 2.3.7 leans on me

I leave that petit rappeurs dem for back house

Stuck in Yaounde they think it’s first class

Sylvie Enow you sef u di nyè me

Etangti momanyang running Jozi

Run Jozi nimanimakenga

Bayangui Godly flow from Heaven

Show you pepper positive rebel

Comot from Bafoussam we the best

Now we deh here

When they see me they bow, nigga wash hand

I be garri inside sand sand

Pray my goddman dues

This is my time




CHORUS 
(LOCKO)

VERSE 2
 ( AKA)

Negger

Kush clouds in the indoor

Top down got me feeling like Sim Dope

Swerve swerve in the benzo

Joburg f**k the world like a nympho

Smash hits by the chuck load

Bad chick in my arm

My squad full of cut throats

Every award show I am in the front row

As far as awards go I do the utmost

One time for the legends

Fellas say the music is a weapon

Now you tongue tired of my presence

Everything I do is truly epic

Lights camera action

First Class flight I am relaxing

Seating back sipping those champers

Supa mega I am established

About to send the Uber to your address


CHORUS 
(LOCKO)

When you see me get down

When you see me get down

When you see me bow down

When you see me bow down

Cuz I’m better than you

I’m better than you...

You now I am getting hiiigh

I’m living in the sky (Sky..)




VERSE 3
 (STANLEY ENOW)

Hold up. Wait wait wait

Boy dem want die for ma cake cake cake

Shawty wanna murder for a date date date

See them walking on my streets like na pay day day Oh yeah

I be blowing hits all year

Selling out shows all year

Man of the year

I see you hustling to get there

You know I am already there

I am the man of the year

U sef you know I don’t play

I be blowing big stacks back in my place

Eating bush meat up in Mamfe

Popping my motherland Rozay




(LOCKO)

Popping my Rozay

Chilling with The King Kong Stanley

Parait que je buzz

Dans les groupes Whatssapp them know me




CHORUS 
(LOCKO)

When you see me get down

When you see me get down

When you see me bow down

When you see me bow down

Cuz I’m better than you

I’m better than you...

You now I am getting hiiigh

I’m living in the sky (Sky..)
