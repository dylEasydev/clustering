 Work Song




I keep on working every day

I keep on warning everyday

Nobody cares what I used to say

They keep on playing every games



While I'm working in the darkness

Oh, I know

You no guess

My sorrow

I keep on warning every night yeah   

I keep on searching everyday too   

I keep on suffering every day   

I keep on calling everyday, anyway

Nobody help me  

And working in the dark is so hard

And I cry   

But nobody hear me



 I work on Monday   

I work on Tuesday  

 I work on Wednesday  

 I work on Thursday   

I work on Friday

Saturday and Sunday

This is my work song

I sing it for workers

This is my work work work song

I sing it for workers

This is my work song

I sing it for workers

This is my work work work song

I sing it for workers





Hey !!!!  



 I keep on working everyday   

I keep on warning everyday

Nobody cares what I used to say

They keep on playing every games

 While I'm working in the darkness

 I keep on warning every night every night

Yeah

I keep on searching everyday too

I keep on suffering every day

I keep on calling everyday, everyday

Nobody help me



Working in the dark is so hard

And I cry   But nobody hear me



 I work on Monday

 I work on Tuesday   

I work on Wednesday   

I work on Thursday   

I work on Friday  

Saturday and Sunday      

This is my Work song
