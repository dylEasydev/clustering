 7 Feet Tall




[Verse 1] :

(yeah!)

Am speeding, am on high speed like okada

Give me little time I know sey I must hama

Haters them take me go court for judge me

But them fail for know sey George they for jungle with them monkeys

My mama born sky scrapper, am 7 feet tall

Like rain them pray make Tyt Ginz fall

Many girls in my crib like roll call

Please no phone calls, leave me text lol!

If you be my ex, no expect my text

Am so busy in this music business

While most of you busy in the industry

Tyt Ginz busy doing the business

Am not a musician though, am an artist

Yes tryna make that ''doh''

Wise man.... Them say i wise like Solomon

U no fit change my position I stand like foundation

 


[CHORUS]

Them want make I fall

But am 7 feet tall

You no fit put me down

[Verse 2]

See this swagless niggas claiming two chains

But I got two things, swag and the business

Tyt Ginz fitness, drive this ngah them any how

I drive this ngah them any how cuz I get license

Born by a wiseman so I get bad sense

I be bangwaman 99.9 sense

We just a few but we taking over the business

Ciana Banks, awu donson, tyt ginz

I respect punctuation marks

My flow is full of quotation marks

Chilling with them smokers

Playing pool snockers

 Just bought a new pair of sneakers

Pimah to them preachers calling us siners




 CHORUS



You no fit make me fall, cuz am 7 feet tall

You no fit put me down cuz am 7 feet tall

You no fit make me fall, cuz am 7 feet tall
