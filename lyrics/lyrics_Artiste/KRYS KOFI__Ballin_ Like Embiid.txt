 Ballin' Like Embiid




They don’t love you when you dream

There’s a light that they don’t see Yeah

They don’t love you when you dream

They don’t love you when you dream

I feel it inside of me

Like I already know I’m gonna Win

That’s why I ain’t gonna quit

Pass me the ball I’m on fire

And I’m goin to the rim

I came from a country where it’s forbidden to dream

When you try to hold on they think that you are ill

Like you got to be locked up in a cell of an embedded society

Listen man we ain’t supposed to have the same priorities

Fuck yo philosophy I’m hungry you dig?

Hope one day Imma be the best of the League

As a matter of fact, I’m the best

Ain’t just recognized yet

They will try to fuck with me

Yeh I know that, that’s how it goes

Reminiscing when they were laughing at my flow

Now they looking for my number and they all call me « bro »

Visualizing my breakthrough when they analyze my growth

Some of ‘em tryna bring my career to a close

God got my clock

I don’t do it for the clout

Fuck being under the cloud

Ain’t here to rap like a clown

No more playtime

Jiggy told me that I got the crown

Why you hatin’ on a dreamer?

Mola I don’t even know ya

I’m a court you spectator

You can’t even shoot a lay up

So shut the fuck up

Got to play the game to change it but the playtime is over

My duck hard

I ball hard

I have balls to balls your career up

I got bars that put rappers behind bars

Trust the Process

Watch me slam Dunk hear the lion roar


They don’t love you when you dream

There’s a light that they don’t see

I feel it inside of me

Like I already know I’m gonna Win

That’s why I ain’t gonna quit

I’ve just started the trip

Pass me the ball I’m on fire

And I’m goin to the rim

Yeah I’m Ballin’ like Embiid

Yeah I’m Ballin’ like Embiid

And I’m Ballin’

And I’m Ballin’

And I’m Ballin’ like Embiid

Yeah I’m Ballin’ like Embiid

Yeah I’m Ballin’ like Embiid

And I’m Ballin’

And I’m Ballin’

And I’m Ballin’ like Embiid
