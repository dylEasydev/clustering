 A No Go Tire




Iye eh… iye eh… (8x)


Iye eh eh, iye eh eh eh


Oh woh woh woh


Oh woh woh woh




Verse 1:

Finally I find

That your love was all I needed

Was looking for love

In all the wrong, wrong places

No one measure up (no one measured up)

To the love that we shared

Bad I realized it

Too late, too late, to say




[CHORUS]:

Yelelelelelelelele, A no go tire

A no go tire, no go tire, not today oh

Yelelelelelelelele, A no go tire

A no go tire, no go tire, not today oh




Verse 2:

You are my best, the very best

That I… that I ever had

Taught me to believe in myself

How to stand on solid ground

When everything is crumbling down

I can feel that you’re around

Loving me through it all

I’ll find my way right back to you

Coz home is where you are




CHORUS

Yelelelelelelelele, A no go tire

A no go tire, no go tire, not today oh

Yelelelelelelelele, A no go tire

A no go tire, no go tire, not today oh



I’m gonna find my way, find my way back home

I’m gonna find my way, find my way back home

I’m gonna find my way, find my way to you Lord

I’m gonna find my way, find my way back home

 

I’m gonna find my way, find my way back home

I’m gonna find my way, find my way back home

I’m gonna find my way, find my way to you Lord

I’m gonna find my way, find my way back home



Find my way back home, find my way back home
